% This file contains a number of patches that addresses bugs in existing style files
% (texlive or conference-provided ones).
%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Patches for option clash on implicitly loaded packages
%
% Some conference style files load some packages without options.
% This causes an error if you try to load the same package with different options.
% PassOptionsToPackage fixed this.
% cf. https://texfaq.org/FAQ-optionclash

% Fix xcolor,colortbl
% (iclr,cvpr -> eso-pic -> xcolor,color)
% (icml -> color)
% (naacl -> xcolor)
\PassOptionsToPackage{svgnames}{xcolor}

% Fix algorithm,algorithmicx (ICML -> algorithm,algorithmicx)
\PassOptionsToPackage{noend}{algorithmic}
\PassOptionsToPackage{noend}{algpseudocode}

% Fix natbib options
\PassOptionsToPackage{numbers}{natbib}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Patches for option clash on implicitly loaded packages
%
% A recent version of lineno started patching some commands in amsmath,
% which introduced a dependency that causes redefinition errors
% when lineno is loaded before amsmath.
% Some style files already have a workaround (e.g. Neurips), but I fix it by myself anyways.

% naacl --- through RequirePackage
% ijcai --- through tex template
% neurips --- patches itself

\AddToHook{package/lineno/before}{\RequirePackage{amsmath}}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% mimick natbib without natbib, if not loaded.
% This is useful for theapa.sty used by jair.
