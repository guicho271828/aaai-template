\section{Example Introduction}

[The text is edited from a famous latex template for Kakenhi Grant
Proposal (Japanese version of NSF in US) and translated into English.]

The true purpose of this study is, in a nutshell, to fulfill the childhood dream of finding an elephant egg.

\section{Background}

The purpose of this research is
a multifaceted investigation of elephant egg shells from biological, chemical, theoretical, and engineering aspects.
Elephant egg shells weigh more than 80 kg.
It is necessary not only to support the weight of the elephant and its
nutrient source, the large mass of the yolk, but also the weight of the
parent elephant that warms the egg. For this reason, the elephant egg
shell is considered to have a structure that is entirely different
from that of bird's (Fig. 1) egg shell. Also, if the mechanism
of the elephant egg shell is clarified,

\begin{itemize}
 \item Elucidation of elephant ecology, understanding of dinosaur egg structure (biology),
 \item Elucidation of shell chemical formation reaction (chemistry),
 \item Research on the relationship between the atomic level structure of the shell and C60 and nanoclusters Research (physics),
 \item Artificially create an elephant shell and apply it to the body of a car (engineering)
\end{itemize}

The impact on science and society is immeasurable.

\section{Method}

We traveled around the world to find elephant eggs. This has also been a dream since I was a kid.

\section{Related Work}

According to \citet{folbre1997future},
In ``Horton Hatches the Egg'' \cite{seuss1968horton},
a tired mother bird asked Horton the elephant to give her a break and
sit on the nest instead, which resulted in a chick with a small trunk and
elephant ears.
\citet{kipling1983elephant} discuss how the elephant got its long trunk.
\citet{cooper2001complete} analyzed the mitochondria DNA sequence of the extinct Elephant-Bird species,
such as \emph{Aepyornis maximus}.
\citet{carlqvist2003theory} studied the astronomical object called Twisted Elephant Trunks
based on the magnetic flux ropes between molecular clouds.

Existing work studied the eggs of the blue whale.
While blue whales and elephants are mammals, they live in completely different habitats.

\section{Conclusion}

We could not find Elephant's eggs.

\section*{Checklist}

Elephant egg ES cells are not cultured or elephant clones are not
generated. Since elephant individuals are not taken out of the field,
they do not conflict with the Washington Convention and the Convention
on Biological Diversity. In addition, since no recombination experiment
is conducted, it does not conflict with the Cartagena Protocol.
