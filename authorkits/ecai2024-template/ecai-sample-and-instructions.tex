\section{Introduction}

The European Conference of Artificial Intelligence (ECAI) is the leading
discipline-wide conference on AI in Europe. Its history goes back all
the way to the Summer Conference on Artificial Intelligence and
Simulation of Behaviour held in July 1974 in Brighton. Nowadays, ECAI is
organised annually under the auspices of the European Association for
Artificial Intelligence (EurAI, see Figure~\ref{fig:eurai}).

\end{figure}

Your paper should be typeset in \LaTeX, using the ECAI class file
provided (\texttt{ecai.cls}). Please do not modify the class file or
any of the layout parameters.

For instructions on how to submit your work to ECAI and on matters such
as page limits or referring to supplementary material, please consult
the Call for Papers of the next edition of the conference. Keep in mind
that you must use the \texttt{doubleblind} option for submission.

\section{Typeset section headers in sentence case}

You presumably are already familiar with the use of \LaTeX. But let
us still have a quick look at how to typeset a simple equation:
%
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq:vcg}
p_i(\boldsymbol{\hat{v}}) & = &
\sum_{j \neq i} \hat{v}_j(f(\boldsymbol{\hat{v}}_{-i})) -
\sum_{j \neq i} \hat{v}_j(f(\boldsymbol{\hat{v}}))
\end{eqnarray}
%
Use the usual combination of \verb|\label{}| and \verb|\ref{}| to
refer to numbered equations, such as Equation~(\ref{eq:vcg}).
Next, a theorem:

\begin{theorem}[Fermat, 1637]\label{thm:fermat}
No triple $(a,b,c)$ of natural numbers satisfies the equation
$a^n + b^n = c^n$ for any natural number $n > 2$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
A full proof can be found in the supplementary material.
\end{proof}

Table captions should be centred \emph{above} the table, while figure
captions should be centred \emph{below} the figure.\footnote{Footnotes
should be placed \emph{after} punctuation marks (such as full stops).}

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Locations of selected conference editions.}

\begin{tabular}{ll@{\hspace{8mm}}ll}

ECAI-2020 & \multicolumn{3}{l}{Santiago de Compostela (online)} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Citations and references}

Include full bibliographic information for everything you cite,
be it a book \citep{pearl2009causality}, a journal article
\citep{grosz1996collaborative,rumelhart1986learning,turing1950computing},
a conference paper \citep{kautz1992planning}, or a preprint
\citep{perelman2002entropy}. The citations in the previous sentence are
known as \emph{parenthetical} citations, while this reference to the
work of \citet{turing1950computing} is an \emph{in-text} citation.
The use of \BibTeX\ is highly recommended.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%% Use this environment to include acknowledgements (optional).
%%% This will be omitted in doubleblind mode.

\begin{ack}
By using the \texttt{ack} environment to insert your (optional)
acknowledgements, you can ensure that the text is suppressed whenever
you use the \texttt{doubleblind} option. In the final version,
acknowledgements may be included on the extra page intended for references.
\end{ack}
