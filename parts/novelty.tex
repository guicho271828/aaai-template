Novelty metric can be seen as a soft approximation of the close list:
It tries to rank states
by checking how dissimilar a newly generated state is from the set of states that have been generated before.
The metric is defined as the minimum size of the conjunctions of propositions that have never been true
in a set of states generated before.
%
Since computing the novelty with large conjunctions requires an exponentially large storage,
practical implementations restrict the size of conjunctions (thus the maximum value of the metric) to two,
or tries to approximate the compuation through a bloom filter \cite{singh2021approximate}.
We choose the first approach to reduce the implementation effort,
where the novelty is limited to 1, 2, or \emph{larger than} 2.

In practice,
the novelty metric is not measured on the entire set of states generated before,
but rather on its disjoint subsets called the \emph{plateaus} \citet{Asai2017b}
defined by the \emph{type system} \citet{xie14type}.
%
A set of evaluators $\vf=[f_1, f_2, \ldots]$ of a state $s$,
where each $f_i(s)$ evaluates to a number,
is called a \emph{type}.
% These evaluators may include $g$-values, etc, that may not be pure functions or heuristic functions.
A \emph{plateau} is a set of states that evaluates to the same vector.
Heuristic search often gets stuck in a large heuristic plateau without progress,
thus escaping from plateaus via exploration mechanisms has been an important topic
in the literature \cite{Coles07,benton2010g,imai2011novel,Asai2017b,kuroiwa2022biased}.
%
A novelty metric defined by the type $\vf$ is denoted as $w_\vf$.

A best-first search strategy can be defined by a lexcographic ordering of evaluators.
\citet{lipovetzky2017bfws} proposed several strategies,
and claimed that the configuration named $\vf_5=[w_{\ar{g},\ar{r}},\#g]$ achieved the best result,
where $\ar{g}$ denotes goal-count heuristics, and
$\ar{r}$ is a ``relevant fluent count'' metric as called in their implementation (not named in the paper).
Another configuration that is effective is $\vf_4=[w_{\ar{l}, \ff},\ar{l},\ff]$,
where $\ar{l}$ is the landmark-count(sum) heuristic \cite{buchner2023landmark}.

While the majority of research on novelty metric is implemented on Lapkt framework \cite{lapkt},
we use a reimplementation in Fast Downward (FD) release-23.06 \cite{Helmert2006}
in order to avoid the effect of low-level implementation details.
Lapkt framework is optimized for agile search by skipping some optimization steps
at the cost of suboptimal memory usage and other factors.
The major difference between FD and Lapkt is its internal representation:
FD code base uses SAS+ while Lapkt uses the propositional representation.
